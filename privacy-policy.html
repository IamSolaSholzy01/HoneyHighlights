            <h3>HONEYHIGHLIGHTS PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
            <h6>HONEYHIGHLIGHTS (the “Company”) is committed to maintaining robust privacy protections for its users. Our Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to help you understand how we collect, use and safeguard the information you provide to
                us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our Service.
            </h6>
            <h6>For purposes of this Agreement, “Site” refers to the Company’s website, which can be accessed at <a href="https://www.honeyhighlights.com.ng">HoneyHighlights</a>. “Service” refers to the Company’s services accessed via the Site. The terms
                “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to the Company. “You” refers to you, as a user of our Site or our Service.

                I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT
            </h4>
            <h6>We collect “Non-Personal Information” and “Personal Information.” Non-Personal Information includes information that cannot be used to personally identify you, such as anonymous usage data, general demographic information we may collect, referring/exit
                pages and URLs, platform types, preferences you submit and preferences that are generated based on the data you submit and number of clicks. Personal Information includes your email, first name and surname, which you submit to us through
                the registration process at the Site.
            </h6>
            <h5>1. Information collected via Technology</h5>
            <h6>To activate the Service you do not need to submit any Personal Information other than your email address. To use the Service thereafter, you do not need to submit further Personal Information. However, in an effort to improve the quality of
                the Service, we track information provided to us by your browser or by our software application when you view or use the Service, such as the website you came from (known as the “referring URL”), the type of browser you use, the device
                from which you connected to the Service, the time and date of access, and other information that does not personally identify you. We track this information using cookies, or small text files which include an anonymous unique identifier.
                Cookies are sent to a user’s browser from our servers and are stored on the user’s computer hard drive. Sending a cookie to a user’s browser enables us to collect Non-Personal information about that user and keep a record of the user’s
                preferences when utilizing our services, both on an individual and aggregate basis. For example, the Company may use cookies to collect the following information:
                <ul>
                    <li>page views</li>
                    <li>duration on site</li>
                    <li>devices and browser types used</li>
                    <li>referring sites, date/time of visits</li>
                    <li>limited demographic information</li>
                    <li>IP addresses</li>
                </ul>
                The Company may use both persistent and session cookies; persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your session and until you delete them, while session cookies expire when you close your browser.
            </h6>
            <h5>2. Information you provide us by registering for an account</h5>
            <h6>In addition to the information provided automatically by your browser when you visit the Site, to become a subscriber to the Service you will need to create a personal profile. You can create a profile by registering with the Service and entering
                your email address, and creating a user name and a password. By registering, you are authorizing us to collect, store and use your email address in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

                II. HOW WE USE AND SHARE INFORMATION
            </h4>
            <h5>Personal Information: </h5>
            <h6>Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent or otherwise share for marketing purposes your Personal Information with third parties without your consent. We do share Personal Information with vendors who are
                performing services for the Company, such as the servers for our email communications who are provided access to the user's email address for purposes of sending emails from us. Those vendors use your Personal Information only at our direction
                and in accordance with our Privacy Policy. In general, the Personal Information you provide to us is used to help us communicate with you. For example, we use Personal Information to contact users in response to questions, solicit feedback
                from users, provide technical support, and inform users about promotional offers. We may share Personal Information with outside parties if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is
                reasonably necessary to meet any applicable legal process or enforceable governmental request; to enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations; address fraud, security or technical concerns; or to
                protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of our users or the public as required or permitted by law.
            </h6>
            <h5>Non-Personal Information</h5>
            <h6>In general, we use Non-Personal Information to help us improve the Service and customize the user experience. We also aggregate Non-Personal Information in order to track trends and analyze use patterns on the Site. This Privacy Policy does
                not limit in any way our use or disclosure of Non-Personal Information and we reserve the right to use and disclose such Non-Personal Information to our partners, advertisers and other third parties at our discretion. In the event we undergo
                a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge and consent that such transfers may occur
                and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of our assets may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If our information practices change at any time in the future, we will
                post the policy changes to the Site so that you may opt out of the new information practices. We suggest that you check the Site periodically if you are concerned about how your information is used.
            </h6>
            <h4>III. YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING THE USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
            <h6>You have the right at any time to prevent us from contacting you for marketing purposes. When we send a promotional communication to a user, the user can opt out of further promotional communications by following the unsubscribe instructions
                provided in each promotional email. You can also indicate that you do not wish to receive marketing communications from us in the unsubscribe notice on the email sent to you. Please note that notwithstanding the promotional preferences
                you indicate by either unsubscribing or opting out of the Site, we may continue to send you administrative emails including, for example, periodic updates to our Privacy Policy.</h6>
            <h4>IV. LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</h4>
            <h6>As part of the Service, we may provide links to or compatibility with other websites or applications. However, we are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by those websites or the information or content they contain. This Privacy
                Policy applies solely to information collected by us through the Site and the Service. Therefore, this Privacy Policy does not apply to your use of a third party website accessed by selecting a link on our Site or via our Service. To the
                extent that you access or use the Service through or on another website or application, then the privacy policy of that other website or application will apply to your access or use of that site or application. We encourage our users to
                read the privacy statements of other websites before proceeding to use them.
            </h6>
